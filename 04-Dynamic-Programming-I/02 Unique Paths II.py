# Unique Paths II
# Follow up for "Unique Paths":
# Now consider if some obstacles are added to the 
# grids. How many unique paths would there be?
# An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0
# respectively in the grid.
#
# For example,
# There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
#
# [
#  [0,0,0],
#  [0,1,0],
#  [0,0,0]
# ]
# The total number of unique paths is 2.
#
